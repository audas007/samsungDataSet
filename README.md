## Peer Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The code run_analysis.R does the below:

Downloads the data zip from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzips the file, in current working directory, so we have access to : "UCI HAR Dataset"

Thus "UCI HAR Dataset" is in the working directory.

Then source the code
source("run_analysis.R")

After the script is loaded to completion, the result of the tidy data set would be available in the "result" object

The tidy data attached, represents the contents of this 'result' object having 180 rows and 68 columns.

You can check the codebook to see, what the column descriptions are.
